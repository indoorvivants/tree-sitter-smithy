## Installation in Neovim

Smithy has been added to [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) so you can follow normal configuration instructions.

- [Smithy in Neovim: parsing, syntax highlighting, LSP](https://blog.indoorvivants.com/2022-05-12-smithy-neovim) - my blog post documenting the development 
    of the first version of the grammar and integrating it into my Neovim setup

  Since then contributors took it from rough sketch to nearly perfect parser, for which I'm extremely grateful.
